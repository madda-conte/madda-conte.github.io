  title={Churning in Cities: The Volatility Advantage of Large Labor Markets},
  author={Conte, Maddalena and Mejean, Isabelle and Michalski, Tomasz and Schmutz, Benoit},
  year={2024},
  abstract={Firms' labor demand is more volatile in larger cities. We propose and test a novel explanation for this finding. Faster hiring conditions attract productive firms with more volatile activity to denser locations where they can swiftly downsize or expand. We estimate a model of firm location choice using French data and show that (i) firm volatility is almost as predictive of location choice as productivity; (ii) both dimensions reinforce each other. This mechanism reduces the productivity--density gradient among volatile firms. Imperfectly correlated firm-level shocks, combined with higher operating costs induced by density, generate matching economies.},

  title={Moving to opportunity? Networks, information and skill-biased migration},
  author={Conte, Maddalena},
  year={2024},
  abstract={Migration is known to be skill-biased, with high-skilled workers being significantly more mobile than low-skilled workers. This paper studies the role of barriers to mobility and in particular those arising from information frictions. I exploit a strategy that isolates changes in a workerâ€™s information on migration opportunities from other factors driving mobility. This relies on the fact that individuals often learn about jobs through social networks, including former coworkers. I implement this strategy using matched employer-employee data from France and find that increases in information on migration opportunities lead to higher labour market transitions to other cities, but this effect is weaker for low-skilled workers. I then estimate a structural model to quantify the role of information frictions compared to other drivers of mobility. Counterfactual experiments show that information frictions limit migration between cities, especially for low-skilled workers, with stronger negative effects on mobility decisions than standard bilateral migration costs.},

  title={Affordable housing and the labour market},
  author={Conte, Maddalena and Mulalic, Ismir and {van Ommeren}, Jos},
  year={2024},
  abstract={This paper investigates long-run labour market outcomes of affordable housing in a quasi-natural experimental setting for the city of Copenhagen. The empirical setup enables us to compare two key affordable housing policies: home purchase assistance and rent-controlled housing, both directed towards poor households. We compare the impact of these policies on several margins of labour supply. We find that home purchase assistance increases labour market participation, at marginally lower wages, for several years after treatment, both at the intensive and extensive margin. At the same time, it encourages early retirement, so it only slightly increases labour supply over an individual's lifetime, while making moving residence locally more likely. Home purchase assistance thus seem to be more effective than rental subsidies in promoting labour market attachment. }
