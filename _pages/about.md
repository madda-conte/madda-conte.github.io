I am a Senior Research Economist at the <a href='https://www.ipp.eu/'>***Institut des Politiques Publiques***</a> and the <a href='https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/'>***Paris School of Economics***</a>

My research topics are **economic geography and labor economics**. I am also increasingly interested in topics in **environmental economics**, which I aim to study from a labor and spatial perspective.

In November 2024 I defended my PhD in Economics at <a href='https://crest.science/'>*CREST*</a> & <a href='https://www.ip-paris.fr/en'>*Institut Polytechnique de Paris*</a> under the supervision of Benoit Schmutz and Isabelle Mejean.
