I am a Senior Research Economist at the <a href='https://www.ipp.eu/'>***Institut des Politiques Publiques***</a>

My research topics are **labor economics and economic geography**. I am also increasingly interested in topics in **environmental economics**, which I aim to study from a labor and spatial perspective.

In November 2024 I defended my PhD in Economics at *CREST & Institut Polytechnique de Paris* under the supervision of Benoit Schmutz and Isabelle Mejean.

You can find my full CV <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hMRicrYkQpj1WdExWVBfnOagIF7oAP_g/view?usp=drive_link'>**here**</a>
