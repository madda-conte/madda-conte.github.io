I am a Senior Research Economist at the <a href='https://www.ipp.eu'>***Institut des Politiques Publiques***</a> and the <a href='https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/'>***Paris School of Economics***</a>.

My research topics are **economic geography and labor economics**. I am also increasingly interested in topics in **environmental economics**, which I aim to study from a labor and spatial perspective.

In November 2024 I defended my PhD in Economics at <a href='https://crest.science'>*CREST*</a> & <a href='https://www.ip-paris.fr'>*Institut Polytechnique de Paris*</a> under the supervision of Benoit Schmutz and Isabelle Mejean.

I have been awarded the <a href='https://www.afse.fr/en/news/prix-philippe-martin-2025-2448'>Philippe Martin 2025 prize</a> for the best thesis in economic sciences by the Conseil d’analyse économique.

You can find my full CV <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hMRicrYkQpj1WdExWVBfnOagIF7oAP_g/view?usp=drive_link'>**here**</a>
